abstract = {Direct visualization and comparison of the elementary reactions induced by electrons and holes are of importance for finding a way to conduct chemical reactions and reaction sequences in a controllable manner. As a semiconductor, TiO 2 provides a playground to perform the measurements, and moreover, the information can be useful for design of high-performance TiO 2 -based catalysts and photocatalysts. Here, we present our investigation on the elementary reactions of CH 3 OH on TiO 2 surface through visualization of specific elementary steps by highly controllable electron and hole injection using scanning tunneling microscopy. The distinct sequential routes and their kinetics, namely, breaking C-O and O-H bonds by electrons and breaking O-H and C-H bonds by holes, respectively, have been experimentally identified and well elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Our nonlocal h-injection experimental and theoretical results suggest that the delocalized holes in the TiO 2 substrate should be responsible for the temperature-dependent h-route reactions. The locally triggered e-route reaction is associated with the fact that the location of the unoccupied hybridization states is much higher than that of the conduction band onset. Our findings resolve the long-standing debate about the intermediate species and reaction mechanism in photocatalytic oxidation of CH 3 OH. Our proposed protocol offers a powerful means to study elementary reactions induced by electrons and holes on a semiconductor surface in general.},

abstract = {Solvated electron states at the oxide/aqueous interface represent the lowest energy charge-transfer pathways, thereby playing an important role in photocatalysis and electronic device applications. However, their energies are usually higher than the conduction band minimum (CBM), which makes the solvated electrons difficult to utilize in charge-transfer processes. Thus it is essential to stabilize the energy of the solvated electron states. Taking LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO) oxide heterostructure with H2O-adsorbed monolayer as a prototypical system, we show using DFT and ab initio time-dependent nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulation that the energy and dynamics of solvated electrons can be tuned by the electric field in the polar-nonpolar oxide heterostructure. In particular, for LAO/STO with p-type interface, the CBM is contributed by the solvated electron state when LAO is thicker than four unit cells. Furthermore, the solvated electron band minimum can be partially occupied when LAO is thicker than eight unit cells. We propose that the tunability of solvated electron states can be achieved on polar-nonpolar oxide heterostructure surfaces as well as on ferroelectric oxides, which is important for charge and proton transfer at oxide/aqueous interfaces.},

The linewidth, g factor and the integrate ESR intensity show anomalies at the temperature of the spin-density-wave (SDW) ordering.

Our analysis shows that after the electron-hole pair is excited in the K valley in WS2 direct electron transfer from WS2@K to MoS2@K is very difficult because of the weak interlayer coupling in the K valley, and thus, it happens through the T valley as WS2@K-MoS2@T-MoS2@K. When the tensile strain is applied, the energy of WS2@K is decreased, resulting in the suppression of electron transfer. Our study suggests that tuning of the interlayer charge-transfer dynamics by external strain is possible, which provides valuable insights into the functional design of photonic devices based on 2D materials.},

We report a method for rigorous evaluation of the NAC with PAW wave functions and demonstrate an efficient approximation to the rigorous NAC that gives comparable accuracy. As a validation, we intensely examine the NAC matrix elements calculated using both pseudo- and all-electron wave functions under the PAW formalism in six representative systems. The approximate NAC obtained with pseudowave functions is close to the exact all-electron NAC, with the largest deviations observed when subshell d-electrons are involved in the transitions. The developed approach provides a rigorous and convenient methodology for the numerical computation of NAC in the Kohn-Sham theory framework.},

abstract = {TiO2 is an intensively studied photocatalytic material owing to its low cost and high activity. The anatase/rutile (A/R) mixed-phase TiO2 is recognized as an effective strategy to achieve high photocatalytic efficiency by the type-II band alignment favorable to spatial charge separation. However, the atomic structure, as well as the exact band alignment of the A/R mixed-phase TiO2, is very difficult to identify either in experimental measurements or theoretical simulations. Moreover, the time-dependent photogenerated carrier dynamics, which can determine the photocatalytic efficiency, has not been studied at the atomic scale. In this paper, we use an adaptive genetic algorithm to search the stable interface structures. We find that the band alignment is determined by the interfacial atomic structures. Especially, with oxygen vacancy (OV) at the interface, band alignment can be reversed as compared to that of the stoichiometric interface. Then, we select one stoichiometric and one defective structure to study the photogenerated carrier dynamics using the time-dependent ab initio nonadiabatic molecule dynamics. We find that in the stoichiometric system, for both the electron and the hole, the charge transfer happens within 400 fs, which is much shorter than the electron-hole recombination timescale at nanosecond-to-microsecond magnitude, which suggests that the charge transfer can occur efficiently at the interface before they recombine. For the defective A/R system with OV, we find that the electron will be trapped by the defect state within 1 ps, while the hole dynamics is not affected. Our study provides atomic insights into the understanding of the band alignment and photogenerated carrier dynamics at the mixed A/R TiO2 interface, which provides valuable guidance for functional material design for solar energy conversion.},

abstract = {Photogenerated charge carrier dynamics near molecule/TiO2 interfaces are important for the photocatalytic and photovoltaic processes. To understand this fundamental aspect, we performed a time-domain ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics study of the photogenerated hole dynamics at the CH3OH/rutile TiO2(110) interface. We studied the forward and reverse hole transfer between TiO2 and CH3OH as well as the hole energy relaxation to the valence band maximum. First, we show that the hole-trapping ability of CH3OH depends strongly on the adsorption structure. Only when the CH3OH is deprotonated to form chemisorbed CH3O will ∼15% of the hole be trapped by the molecule. Second, we find that strong fluctuations of the HOMO energies of the adsorbed molecules induced by electron-phonon coupling provide additional channels, which accelerate the hole energy relaxation. Third, we demonstrate that the charge transfer and energy relaxation processes depend significantly on temperature. When the temperature decreases from 100 to 30 K, the forward hole transfer and energy relaxation processes are strongly suppressed because of the reduction of phonon occupation. These results indicate that the molecule/TiO2 energy level alignment, thermal excitation of a phonon, and electron-phonon coupling are the key factors that determine the photogenerated hole dynamics. Our studies provide valuable insights into the photogenerated charge and energy transfer dynamics at molecule/semiconductor interfaces.},

A resistivity reentrance due to the antiferromagnetic ordering of Eu2 + spins is observed, indicating the competition between antiferromagnetism (AFM) and superconductivity (SC). It is striking that the resistivity reentrance can be completely suppressed by a small magnetic field due to a field-induced metamagnetic transition from AFM to ferromagnetism (FM). The resistivity reentrance can also be suppressed by the substitution of Eu2 + ions with nonmagnetic Ba2 +/Sr2 + to completely destroy the AFM ordering. These results indicate that the AFM order appears destructive to SC, while FM can coexist with the superconductivity. Further we find that magnon excitation exists in AFM ordering and can be suppressed by an applied field. Coexistence of SC from the FeAs layer and the inner field produced by the ferromagnetic Eu2 + layer suggest a possible p-wave component in the superconducting order parameter. {\textcopyright} 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Taking doped TiO2 as a prototype system and by using time domain ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, we find that the localization of impurity-phonon modes (IPMs) is the key parameter to determine the e-h recombination time scale. Noncompensated charge doping introduces delocalized impurity-phonon modes that induce ultrafast e-h recombination within several picoseconds. However, the recombination can be largely suppressed using charge-compensated light-mass dopants due to the localization of their IPMs. For different doping systems, the e-h recombination time is shown to depend exponentially on the IPM localization. We propose that the observation that delocalized IPMs can induce fast e-h recombination is broadly applicable and can be used in the design and synthesis of functional semiconductors with optimal dopant control.},

However, when the OV sites are fully filled by methanol in the methanol-overdosed sample, the methanol species at the OV sites keep immobile but frequently switch between molecular and dissociative forms, accompanied by dramatically enhanced Had migration. Meanwhile, an established equilibrium shows a concentration ratio of 1:3 between the molecular and dissociative methanol.

abstract = {Hot electron cooling by energy loss to heat through electron-phonon (e-ph) interaction is an important mechanism that can limit the efficiency of solar energy conversion. To avoid such energy loss, sufficient charge separation needs to be realized by extracting hot carriers from the photoconverter before they cool, which requires fast interfacial charge transfer and slow internal hot carrier relaxation. Using ab initio time-dependent nonadiabatic molecular dynamics and taking C60/MoS2 as a prototype system, we show that the superatom molecular orbitals (SAMOs) of fullerenes, which are bound by the central potential of the whole molecule induced by the charge screening, are ideal media for charge separation. The diffuse character of SAMOs results in extremely weak e-ph interaction and therefore acts as a "phonon bottleneck" for hot electron cooling. Furthermore, it also leads to significant hybridization with other atoms at the interface that induces fast charge transfer. The interfacial charge-transfer rate at the C60/MoS2 interface is found to be 2 orders of magnitude faster than the hot electron cooling from s-SAMO in C60. This conclusion is generally applicable for different carbon nanostructures that have SAMOs. The proposed SAMO-induced charge separation provides unique and essential insights into the material design and function for solar energy conversion.},

The energies of the solvated electron band minimum (SEBM) decrease when H 2 O adsorbs dissociatively. Moreover, the surface oxygen vacancies are also helpful for stabilizing the solvated electron band.

Through the investigation of three intrinsic defects with shallow and deep defect states in monolayer BP, it is found that, surprisingly, none of these defects significantly accelerates the e-h recombination. Further analysis shows that because monolayer BP is a monoelemental material, the distinct impurity phonon, which often induces fast e-h recombination, is not formed. Moreover, because of the flexibility of 2D material, the defects scatter the phonons present in pristine BP, generating multiple modes with lower frequencies compared with the pristine BP, which further suppresses the e-h recombination. We propose that the conclusion can be extended to other monoelemental 2D materials, which is important guidance for the future design of functional semiconductors.},

abstract = {The most critical bottleneck in CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction lies in the activation of CO<sub>2</sub> to form an anion radical, CO<sub>2</sub>•-, or other intermediates by the photoexcited electrons, because CO<sub>2</sub> has a high-energy lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Taking rutile TiO2(110) as a prototypical surface, we use time-dependent ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations to reveal that the excitation of bending and antisymmetric stretching vibrations of CO<sub>2</sub> can sufficiently stabilize the CO<sub>2</sub> LUMO below the conduction band minimum, allowing it to trap photoexcited hot electrons and get reduced. Such vibrational excitations occur by formation of a transient CO<sub>2</sub>•- adsorbed in an oxygen vacancy. CO<sub>2</sub> can trap the hot electrons for nearly 100 fs and dissociate to form CO within 30-40 fs after the trapping. We propose that the activation of the CO<sub>2</sub> bending and antisymmetric stretching vibrations driven by hot electrons applies to other CO<sub>2</sub> reduction photocatalysts and can be realized by different techniques and material design.},

Contrary to general expectation, efficient electron-hole separation can occur in vertically stacked transition-metal dichalcogenide heterostructure bilayers through ultrafast charge transfer between the neighboring layers despite their weak vdW bonding. In this report, we show by ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics calculations, that instead of direct tunneling, the ultrafast interlayer hole transfer is strongly promoted by an adiabatic mechanism through phonon excitation occurring on 20 fs, which is in good agreement with the experiment. The atomic level picture of the phonon-assisted ultrafast mechanism revealed in our study is valuable both for the fundamental understanding of ultrafast charge carrier dynamics at vdW heterointerfaces as well as for the design of novel quasi-2D devices for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications.},

By using time-dependent ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, we study the dynamics of photogenerated electrons at a BP/InSe heterostructure interface and observethe highly efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs at the interface. Instead of direct tunneling, the ultrafast transfer of excited electrons is significantly promoted by an adiabatic mechanism related to thermally excited nuclear motions stemming from strong e-p coupling and phonon excitation, and a small energy difference of donor-acceptor states. The internal quantum efficiency for charge separation can reach up to 99.6% and improved optical absorption is also observed in this heterostructure, making the BP/InSe heterostructure a compelling optoelectronic material.},

abstract = {Molecular-level understanding of the dehydrogenation of interfacial water molecules on metal oxides and their interactive nature relies on the ability to track the motion of light and small hydrogen atoms, which is known to be difficult. Here, we report precise measurements of the surface-facilitated water dehydrogenation process at terminal Ti sites of TiO2(110) using scanning tunneling microscopy. Our measured hydrogen-bond dynamics of H2O and D2O reveal that the vibrational and electronic excitations dominate the sequential transfer of two H (D) atoms from a H2O (D2O) molecule to adjacent surface oxygen sites, manifesting the active participation of the oxide surface in the dehydrogenation processes. Our results show that, at the stoichiometric Ti5c sites, individual H2O molecules are energetically less stable than the dissociative form, where a barrier is expected to be as small as approximately 70-120 meV on the basis of our experimental and theoretical results. Moreover, our results reveal that interfacial hydrogen bonds can effectively assist H atom transfer and exchange across the surface. The revealed quantitative hydrogen-bond dynamics provide a new atomistic mechanism for water interactions on metal oxides in general.},

abstract = {The covalent triazine framework CTF-1 as a member of the two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is a category of novel metal-free photocatalysts for water splitting. The large band gap severely restricts its energy conversion efficiency. By means of the first-principles calculations, we proposed the decoration of CTF-1 by anchoring halogen atoms onto benzene moieties for improving the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency. The electronic structures reveal that the halogen substitution successfully decreases the band gap of CTF-1. Meanwhile, the calculated free energy changes along the reaction pathway indicate that all these COFs can spontaneously drive overall water splitting under light irradiation in a specific acid-base environment. The time-dependent ab initio non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the electron-hole recombination periods of these COFs fall in a few to tens of nanoseconds. Excitingly, CTF-1 modified by linking six iodine atoms onto the benzene ring in the para-position (CTF-1-6I) shows a quite low band gap of 2.81 eV, indicating that it is a visible-light driven COF for overall photocatalytic water splitting. Correspondingly, CTF-1-6I also exhibits an extraordinarily promising STH efficiency of 3.70%, which is an order magnitude higher than that of the pristine CTF-1.},

abstract = {Low-cost solution-based synthesis of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) invariably introduces defects in the system, which could form Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) electron-hole recombination centers detrimental to solar conversion efficiency. Here, we investigate the nonradiative recombination processes due to native point defects in methylammonium lead halide (MAPbI3) perovskites using ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics within surface-hopping framework. Regardless of whether the defects introduce a shallow or deep band state, we find that charge recombination in MAPbI3 is not enhanced, contrary to predictions from SRH theory. We demonstrate that this strong tolerance against defects, and hence the breakdown of SRH, arises because the photogenerated carriers are only coupled with low-frequency phonons and electron and hole states overlap weakly. Both factors appreciably decrease the nonadiabatic coupling. We argue that the soft nature of the inorganic lattice with small bulk modulus is key for defect tolerance, and hence, the findings are general to other MHPs.},

abstract = {Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures of transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors are central not only for fundamental science, but also for electro- and optical-device technologies where the interfacial charge transfer is a key factor. Ultrafast interfacial charge dynamics has been intensively studied, however, the atomic scale insights into the effects of the electron-phonon (e-p) coupling are still lacking. In this paper, using time dependent ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, we study the ultrafast interfacial charge transfer dynamics of two different TMD heterostructures MoS2/WS2 and MoSe2/WSe2, which have similar band structures but different phonon frequencies. We found that MoSe2/WSe2 has softer phonon modes compared to MoS2/WS2, and thus phonon-coupled charge oscillation can be excited with sufficient phonon excitations at room temperature. In contrast, for MoS2/WS2, phonon-coupled interlayer charge oscillations are not easily excitable. Our study provides an atomic level understanding on how the phonon excitation and e-p coupling affect the interlayer charge transfer dynamics, which is valuable for both the fundamental understanding of ultrafast dynamics at vdW hetero-interfaces and the design of novel quasi-two-dimensional devices for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications.},

abstract = {We systematically investigated the photocatalytic reaction of methanol on the TiO2 (110)-(1 × 1) surface under irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) light performed at various conditions, using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) jointed with temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) techniques. Our STM and TPD results show that the photocatalytic reaction is indeed initiated from the molecular methanol at the 5-fold coordinated Ti sites, as commonly ascribed to the methanol oxidation by the photogenerated holes, reflecting the highly photoactive nature of methanol. The formaldehyde yield from the TPD results is much smaller by a factor of 2/3 than the amount of dissociated methanol from the STM results at 80 K. This observation can be assigned to the reverse reaction during the TPD measurement, and may explain the lower yield of formaldehyde using molecular methanol than using methoxy. From the fractal-like reaction kinetics of methanol, we can associate the coverage-dependence of the spectral dimensions with the change for the diffusion of holes across the surface from a one-dimensional to a two-dimensional behavior because of the increased scattering species at higher coverages. Our results here provide a clear picture for the photocatalytic reaction of molecular methanol and may rationalize the different observations performed at various conditions.},

To understand the dynamics of the photogenerated spin hole current, we perform a time-domain ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics investigation with different initial excitation and temperature. First, the spin hole relaxes in a band-by-band manner. Therefore a longer lifetime can be achieved if the initial hole is generated at the lower edge of the impurity bands. Second, the phonon excitation is found to affect the spin hole dynamics significantly. When the temperature is decreased from 100 to 50 K, the hole relaxation across the band gap is strongly suppressed by the phonon bottleneck, which is due to the reduction of the phonon occupations. Our results show that the initial hole generation and phonon excitation are two key factors determining the dynamics of the photogenerated spin hole, which provide insights into the design of optimal spintronic devices.},

In this work, by ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulation, we find the single atom doping from phosphorus family elements can sufficiently tune the carrier lifetime in black phosphorene (BP). Instead of forming electron-hole (e-h) recombination centers, the e-h recombination is suppressed by doping compared with the pristine BP. Moreover, it is found the carrier lifetime has a strong correlation with the mass of the doping atoms. A doping atom with larger mass leads to a longer lifetime. With the heaviest family element Bi doping, the carrier lifetime increases from 0.29 to 5.34 ns. This trend can be understood from the reduction of the nuclear velocity due to the heavy doping atom. We propose this conclusion can be extended to other monoelemental 2D semiconductors, which provides important guidance for the future design of functional nanodevices.},

abstract = {Mimicking the natural photosynthesis in plants, Z-scheme water splitting is a promising strategy to improve photocatalytic activity. Searching for the direct Z-scheme photocatalysts is urgent and the crucial factor for the photocatalytic efficiency is the photogenerated electron-hole (e-h) recombination rate at the interface of two photosystems. In this report, based on time-dependent ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) investigation, we first report a two-dimensional (2D) metal-free van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure consisting of monolayer BCN and C2N as a promising candidate for direct Z-scheme photocatalysts for water splitting. It is shown that the time scale of e-h recombination of BCN/C2N is within 2 ps. Among such e-h recombination events, more than 85% are through the e-h recombination at the interface. NAMD simulations based on frozen phonon method prove that such an ultrafast interlayer e-h recombination is assisted by intralayer optical phonon modes and the interlayer shear phonon mode induced by vdW interaction. In these crucial phonon modes, the interlayer relative movements which are lacking in traditional heterostructures with strong interactions, yet exist generally in various 2D vdW heterostructures, are significant. Our results prove that the 2D vdW heterostructure family is convincing for a new type of direct Z-scheme photocatalysts searching.},
